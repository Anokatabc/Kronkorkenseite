        <p class="text-index">Stay a while, if you will, and I will let you know a little about this hobby of mine. I like to enjoy my drinks with friends, on travels, and every once in a while I collect the cap as a means to remember those experiences. If you feel like sticking around and checking out my collection, knock yourself out! <br> You can find my collection via the menu on the top, or just click <a href="collection.php" class="linkToCollection"><b><u>here!</b></u></a> (to my Collection)</p>

        <p class="text-index">he had created this website as a means to keep track of my collection thus far. If possible I would like to find more and more tastes that he had not experienced yet. It feels like the more variety I experience, the more complete I get as a person. Maybe you know that feeling as well. And why not share this with other people who may potentially enjoy it as well? Win-win!</p>
